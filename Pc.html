       <p>Pc gaming can be considered the best way to play video games</br>A high-end pc can run a game at its best possible way. PCs are far more powerful than consoles. When you strip it down, gaming consoles are just miniature computers that are capable of many of the same things. But there have to be some sacrifices made to shove a computer inside a relatively small gaming console.</p>
       <p> When you purchase a gaming PC, it just means it has parts that are powerful enough to run the most demanding games. It doesnâ€™t mean it is only thin you can do with it. You can use a PC for almost anything besides just gaming.</p>
       <p>PCs also offer more games than consoles in general. Most games are created on PC and then ported to console. In some cases, games will release on PC first as the porting process can take a lot of time and effort for developers to complete.</P>
