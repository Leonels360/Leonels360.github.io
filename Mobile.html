     <p>Mobile gaming is often referred to by many as not "real gaming" and the reasons for that aren't exactly news to anyone. Poor graphics, bad storylines, horrible touch controlsâ€¦ you know the story.
     </p>
     <p>Assuming that a mobile game becomes popular, it can turn out to be more profitable than an equivalent console game. Why? Because almost everyone in the world owns a smartphone but gaming consoles like PlayStation or Xbox have to be bought exclusively to enjoy the hobby and are thus more expensive from the get-go and at a much smaller demographic.</p>
     <p>As tech is making progress in phones better and bigger games will be devoloped for them. Take for example the mobile version of fortnite and pubg. These games would have been impossible a few years ago in mobile devices.</P>
      <p>However there is a big issue with mobile gaming clear in the mind of most gamers. That is the game format as well as business model. Most mobile games suffer lame game design like are the hundred of games that basically play like candy crush or something like subway surfurs.</p>
      <p>The mobile game business model is likely what cripples better game design. Like most games are free to play they are plagued with premium in-game currencies that cost real world maoney.</p>
      <p>These currencies are in turn used to purchase in-game items or perklike bonuses. In some cases these practices end up making it pay to win.</p>
      <p>In any mobile gaming is growing exponentialy in both size and quality. The ability to play games on the go and killing some time is a big reason for its growth</p>
