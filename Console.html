   <p>To build a PC with roughly the same power as the new generation of consoles, you would need to pay at least two or three times more. That was always the case, and even though consoles like PS5 are now basically a customized PC, things haven't changed a bit. This happens because console makers aren't trying to make money on hardware.</p>
   <p> Consoles also have the upperhand when it comes to optimization.</br> Since consoles have a product hardware uniformity, developers just have to optimize for one set of hardware except obviously between different consoles</P>
